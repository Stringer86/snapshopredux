# Controllers

Now that the catalog view has been built out, Merv wants to see views with dynamic changes.

## Assignment

1. Initialize the application with `ng-app` and load `app.js` to initialize the angular module.
1. Remove the boilerplate controller that you used yesterday for the catalog.
1. Create a new catalog controller from scratch using the principles from today's lesson.
1. Create more controllers for your store based on the database data (or not). Some ideas may include:
  * A shopping cart that adds up subtotal, tax, and total
  * Delivery details
  * Pickup scheduling
  * Order summary
  * Order receipt
  * Order gallery
